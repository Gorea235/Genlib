Genlib
======

This is a general library containing various functions, extention and classes that extend the capibility of the .NET framework.

I made this project simple as a way to "compile" code from various sources into a single usable project.

Genlib is the .NET Core port of the original version of the library, however GenlibWin is the old .NET Framework version. Both will be kept in line with each other (the win version uses links to get the source files so changes are kept accross platforms), however only GenlibWin will have the logging (due to the windows-only portion) and wpf extensions (as this is only windows).
